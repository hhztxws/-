If Tomorrow Is Another Life
如果明天是另一种生活
Max died at his 45, six months after he resigned from a governmental authority where he had worked for 20 years,
马克思在45岁那年去世，他从一个政府机关辞职后6个月，他已经在那里工作了20年，
1 year after his beloved little angel was born, 
在他心爱的小天使出生后1年，
and one day right before he would be entrusted with an important assignment which should lead a career success for him. 
在他将被委以重任的前一天，他将被赋予一项重要的任务，这应该是他事业上的成功。
No one would be able to link a midnight heart attack with him, a bright, energetic motorcyclist. 
没有人能够把半夜心脏病发作的他和他这个聪明的、精力充沛的摩托车手联系在一起。
It seemed that even you have done everything you can to devote to your life, 
看来，即使是你倾尽了所有的心血，
you may still be taken by your fate with no reason can be detected by man. 
也有可能被命运无缘无故的带走，被人察觉。
All his sweet smiles on the pictures left behind him, though, 
不过，他身后留下的照片上所有的甜美笑容，
show that all these heart beating moments can never be taken away even if tomorrow is another life. 
都说明了这一切让人心动的瞬间，即使明天是另一个生命，也无法带走。
We all love you, Max. We won’t miss you too much, as you wished.
我们都爱你，马克斯。我们不会太想你，如你所愿。
